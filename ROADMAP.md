## Current Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Active phase** | Phase 8 — UX/UI & Visual Design Pass (page-by-page, tracked in [UX-DESIGN-PASS.md](UX-DESIGN-PASS.md)) |
| **Last session** | **Palette refinement merged to `main` as stable version (Decision #36).** Method-panel titles and landing hero "What is? / What if?" converted to ink-block chips; panel surface warmed to `#ECE6D9`. Remaining palette items (halftone intensity, analysis stat numbers, references legibility) parked for a later pass. |
| **Immediate next** | **[Critical] Verify Supabase RLS** — confirm policies don't expose passwords to anon reads (security backlog). Then: card type differentiation, small UX wins (duplicate card, filter-bar compress, references legibility), mobile read-only pass. |
| **Supabase project** | `https://bnqmmdymxfcptfxgvxzm.supabase.co` — EU West (Frankfurt) |
| **sessionStorage keys** | `whats-active-project`, `whats-access-{projectId}`, `whats-seeded`, `whats-creative-sparks-{id}`, `whats-creative-ideas-{id}` |
| **localStorage keys** | `whats-session-id`, `whats-user-name` (annotation identity); `whats-analysis-views-{id}` (saved analysis views). All card/project data is in Supabase. |
| **Dev environment** | VS Code + Live Server + Claude extension |

## What We've Built

A complete multi-project research card platform with:

- **Landing page** (`index.html`) — project grid with search, "Create new project" CTA, password modal
- **Card gallery** (`gallery.html?project=id`) — filterable grid of A4 cards, What Is? / What If? tabs, print mode
- **Single card view** (`card.html`) — full-size card, prev/next nav, edit/delete, print, share, linked card chips, reactions + comments
- **Card creation** (`create.html`) — edit-in-place A4 card with image drag/drop/pan/zoom, tag autocomplete, What Is?→What If? link picker
- **Project creation** (`create-project.html`) — name/description/passwords form with live tile preview
- **Analysis dashboard** (`analysis.html`) — tag frequency chart, coverage map (WI↔WIF links), timeline, affinity groups, outlier panels
- **About** (`about.html`)

### Access model (client-side prototype)
- Editor password → full CRUD
- Workshop password → annotate-only (reactions + comments, no create/edit/delete)
- No password → automatically editor access
- Stored in `sessionStorage` per project

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML + CSS + vanilla JS | No framework needed yet — keeping it simple |
| Data storage v1 | `localStorage` + `sessionStorage` | No backend needed for prototype |
| Data storage v2 | Supabase (Postgres + RLS) — **EU region (Frankfurt)** | Free tier, beginner-friendly. RLS mandatory. |
| PDF export | **html2canvas + jsPDF download** (one card per A4 page) | Browser print dialog was too unreliable (margins/scaling/headers); see Decision #28 |
| Hosting | Netlify (v1) | Free, Git-connected |
| Dev environment | VS Code + Live Server + Claude extension | In-editor AI |

## Research-Informed Principles

1. **This is not "another Miro."** The value is a *structured, research-grounded method* — two card types, A4 template, grounded linking. Resist feature creep toward generic canvas tools.
2. **Design for print from Phase 1.** The card HTML/CSS must stay print-friendly.
3. **Grounded speculation is the method's soul.** What If? cards linking to What Is? cards is core, not optional.
4. **Security is a design task.** The shared-password model must map deliberately to Supabase RLS before Phase 7.
5. **Low threshold wins or loses citizen users.** Playfulness, minimal text entry, one clear action per screen.
6. **Minimise personal data.** No-accounts model keeps annotations naturally anonymous.

## Decisions Log

| # | Question | Decision | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project name | **"What Is? / What If?"** | Brief |
| 2 | Card proportions | **A4 landscape** — matches print template | Brief |
| 3 | Tags | **Hybrid** — suggest existing, allow new | Brief |
| 4 | Collaboration model | **Two passwords per project** — editor (full access) + workshop (annotate only). No user accounts. | Brief |
| 5 | Languages | **English UI for v1** | Brief |
| 6 | Card types | **Two types only** — What Is? + What If? | Brief |
| 7 | Hosting | **Netlify + Supabase** | Brief |
| 8 | User accounts | **No accounts** — name typed manually per card | Brief |
| 9 | Author attribution | **Name field on card template** — no login needed | Brief |
| 10 | Frontend framework | **Vanilla JS** — no framework needed, reassess if complexity grows | R&D |
| 11 | PDF export | **Browser print + `@media print`** primary | R&D |
| 12 | Fonts | **System fonts** for now | R&D |
| 13 | Supabase security | **RLS mandatory** — design access model before Phase 7 | R&D |
| 14 | Data model | **`projectId` on every card** — enables RLS and multi-project from day 1 | Phase 2 |
| 15 | Visual approach | **Function first, design later.** Full visual pass after tool works end-to-end. | Phase 1 |
| 16 | Card shadow | **Hard offset shadow** — solid, 5px offset. No blur. | Phase 1 |
| 17 | Background | **Halftone dot pattern** — Mac System 6 / 80s comic aesthetic | Phase 1 |
| 18 | Card distinction | **Shadow colour** — green for What Is?, pink for What If? | Phase D |
| 19 | Annotation model | **Session reactions + named comments.** UUID in localStorage for reactions; display name for comments. | Phase 5 |
| 20 | Shared data layer | **`js/data.js` loaded first on every page** — project mgmt, cards, tag helpers, renderCard, etc. | Phase 5 |
| 21 | Multi-project | **Multiple projects in localStorage** — `whats-projects` array; sample project always available | Phase M |
| 22 | Access control | **sessionStorage per project** — `whats-access-{id}` = "editor" \| "workshop". Password checked client-side (Supabase RLS in Phase 7). | Phase M |
| 23 | URL design | `gallery.html?project=id`, `card.html?id=&project=id`, `analysis.html?project=id` | Phase M |
| 24 | Unified gallery | **What is? + What if? in one gallery** (no separate type-pages). In-page `ALL / WHAT IS? / WHAT IF?` type filter; viewing box offers both create actions; nav has a single **Gallery** link. Supersedes #6's two-page split for browsing. | Phase 8 |
| 25 | House style casing | **Lowercase-i "What is?" / "What if?"** site-wide in UI text (ALL-CAPS logos/labels exempt). | Phase 8 |
| 26 | Card + background | **Card surface stays plain white, no pattern/colour** (type shown only via shadow + header label). **Page background = light-grey halftone dots.** Revisits #17/#18; the What is?/What if? card differentiation is parked for the next design iteration. | Phase 8 |
| 27 | Tag palette | **12 muted riso tones**, hashed per tag (expanded from 5). | Phase 8 |
| 28 | PDF export method | **html2canvas + jsPDF download** (A4-landscape, one card per page). Browser print + `@media print` was implemented then **rejected** — the print dialog (margins/scaling/added headers) was too unreliable. Reverses #11. Trade-off: raster output (text not selectable). | Phase 8 |
| 29 | Draft cards | **`draft` boolean column** + "Mark as draft" action and DRAFT marker; Drafts sort view in the gallery. | Phase 8 |
| 30 | About header | **Full shared project header** (matches gallery), wired via `js/about.js` to the active project. | Phase 8 |
| 32 | Reactions stack | **Reactions accumulate** — each press adds another (no per-session toggle), so several people (incl. on one shared device) can mark the same card "interesting" / "low hanging fruit" etc.; a − button removes one. Each reaction is a row, so counts flow straight into the Analysis annotation panel. Refines #19. | Phase 8 |
| 31 | AI functionality | **On hold (2026-06-17).** No Anthropic-API / embeddings / LLM features for now — incl. creative-mode V2 (AI prompts), analysis auto-synthesis / "ask your project" / AI theme suggestions / embeddings clustering. Pursue non-AI options only until lifted. | Phase 8 |
| 33 | Analysis dashboard | **Rebuilt as an exploration surface** (not diagnostics): one shared filter drives every panel (brushing) + hover previews; cut timeline/matrix/health; treemap, breadth & gaps, axis 2×2, two-level affinity, force-directed Connections, cross-tab, tag hygiene, per-category annotations, Compare, Saved views. Missing WI↔WIF links are a *nudge*, not a flag. Plan: [ANALYSIS-PLAN.md](ANALYSIS-PLAN.md). | Phase 8 |
| 34 | Creative mode direction | **Session dashboard with several no-AI techniques** (not one): Constraint · Provocation · Random word · Combine two — combinatorial + constraint-based + provocation, grounded in [CreativeR&D.md](CreativeR&D.md). Resolves the combine-vs-constraint question as "both, as modes." V1 on branch `creative-redesign`; later-phase follow-up logged. | Phase 8 |
| 35 | Colour scheme → Risograph | **Authentic Riso inks** (hoi! RISOklubb chart) replace the muted palette: Yellow #FFE800 · Fluo pink #FF48B0 · Red #F15060 · Orange #FF6C2F · Aqua #5EC8E5 · Blue #0078BF · Teal #00838A · Green #00A95C (+ `-ink` text variants). What is?=green, What if?=pink. 16-ink tag palette; two-ink halftone background; WI/WIF labels as ink-block chips. Parked mid-pass, refined in Decision #36. | Phase 8 |
| 36 | Palette refinement | **Ink-block chips extended** to landing hero "What is? / What if?" and method-panel titles. Panel surface warmed to `--color-surface: #ECE6D9`. Merged to `main` as stable version. Remaining items (halftone intensity, analysis stat numbers, references-strip legibility) parked for a later pass. | Phase 8 |

## Phase M — Multi-project Platform
**Goal:** The tool supports multiple projects, each with their own cards, passwords, and access levels.
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] `index.html` replaced with landing page — hero intro, project grid with search, password modal
- [x] `gallery.html` — project card gallery (moved from index.html), project-aware, access-enforced
- [x] `create-project.html` — project creation form with name, passwords, live tile preview
- [x] `analysis.html` — analysis dashboard: tag frequency, coverage map, timeline, affinity groups, outliers
- [x] `js/landing.js` — renders project tiles, handles password flow, stores access in sessionStorage
- [x] `js/create-project.js` — saves new project, grants editor access, redirects to gallery
- [x] `js/analysis.js` — all five visualisation panels, responsive SVG-based
- [x] `js/data.js` extended — `getProjects()`, `getProject()`, `saveProject()`, `getActiveProjectId()`, `getProjectAccess()`, `setProjectAccess()`, `loadActiveProject()`, `getProjectCards()`
- [x] `js/app.js` rewritten — project-aware, access control, project-filtered cards
- [x] `js/card.js` updated — project param in all URLs, edit/delete hidden for workshop users
- [x] `js/create.js` updated — project-aware redirects, back/cancel links

### Analysis visualisations
- **Tag frequency** — horizontal dual bars per tag, WI green / WIF pink, top 24 tags
- **Coverage map** — SVG dot diagram: WI cards left, WIF cards right, bezier lines for links, grey = unlinked
- **Timeline** — SVG scatter with WI above / WIF below a date axis, jitter for overlapping dates
- **Affinity groups** — cards clustered by top 16 tags, clickable chips linking to card view
- **Outliers** — four panels: unaddressed WI observations, ungrounded WIF ideas, cards without tags, single-author tags

---

## Phase D — Design & Gallery UX
**Goal:** Polish card template, gallery UX, filtering, background modes.
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] Card shadow colour encodes type (green = WI, pink = WIF)
- [x] Card header: type label centred via CSS grid
- [x] References strip along right card edge
- [x] Gallery: project credits box beside description
- [x] Gallery: filter buttons scoped to current card type
- [x] Tag colours: Risograph palette, consistent per tag via string hash
- [x] Tag autocomplete in create mode
- [x] Image drag/pan/zoom in create mode
- [x] Sticky header with project name (acts as back-to-grid button)
- [x] Sticky action bar: What Is? / What If? type toggle + New card button (always floating)
- [x] What Is? / What If? background mode switching (warm rose halftone for WIF)
- [x] Full-width search across card title, body, author, tags, references
- [x] "Organise by theme" — horizontal swim-lane sections with divider lines
- [x] "Organise by creator" — same swim-lane layout per author
- [x] Author and tag filter rows with "All" button
- [x] Compact project info bar with expandable details

### Remaining design work → moved to Phase 8
The visual design pass (GT Mechanik typography, Cedric Price RE:CP direction, card image effects) is deferred until the tool is deployed and used in a real project. Deploying first gives real usage context for design decisions.

---

## Phase 5 — Single Card View & Annotations
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] `card.html` + `js/card.js` — full-size card, prev/next nav, keyboard arrows
- [x] Action bar: Back, position indicator, Print, Share, Edit, Delete
- [x] Edit → `create.html?edit=id&project=id`
- [x] Delete — removes from localStorage or adds to deleted-samples list
- [x] Print — popup window, auto-print, auto-close
- [x] Share — copies clean URL to clipboard
- [x] Card links — "Grounded in" (WIF→WI) and "Related ideas" (WI→WIF) chips
- [x] Annotations — session reactions + named comment thread

### Still to do
- [ ] Print cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] "Download as image" PNG (html2canvas fallback)

---

## Phase 6 — Deploy & Share
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Why this comes before the visual design pass
The tool works end-to-end. Real usage in a real project will give better context for design decisions than designing speculatively. Deploy first, then design for what actually needs improving.

### Part A — Data portability (do first, enables sharing before Supabase)
Without this, collaborators on different devices have no way to share cards. JSON export/import is a one-afternoon build that unblocks real multi-person use.

- [ ] **Export**: "Download project as JSON" button in the project settings or analysis page — exports all project cards + metadata as a `.json` file
- [ ] **Import**: "Import from JSON" file picker — merges cards by ID, skips duplicates, places into the active project
- [ ] Decide where the import/export UI lives (project bar on gallery? settings panel?)

### Part B — Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Create GitHub repo (`what-is-what-if` or `whats-tool`), push current codebase
- [ ] Create Netlify account, connect to GitHub repo — auto-deploys on push to `main`
- [ ] Test all pages on live URL (no build step — pure HTML/CSS/JS, serves directly)
- [ ] Write `README.md` with tool description + how to use

### Decisions to make
- [ ] Domain: free Netlify subdomain or custom?
- [ ] Import/export UI location: gallery project bar? analysis page sidebar?

### What to check before deploying
- All asset paths are relative ✓
- `js/data.js` loads first on every page ✓
- No `localhost` hardcoded URLs ✓
- `crypto.randomUUID()` requires HTTPS — deploy actually fixes this ✓

---

## Phase 7 — Backend & Collaboration (Supabase)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] Supabase project created — EU West (Frankfurt), RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] Three tables: `projects`, `cards`, `annotations` — with RLS policies (anon role, password checks stay client-side)
- [x] `js/db.js` — new async data layer: field mapping (camelCase JS ↔ snake_case DB), CRUD for all three tables, `ensureSampleData()` seeding
- [x] `js/data.js` — removed all localStorage data functions; kept constants, SAMPLE_CARDS, session helpers, rendering utilities
- [x] All page JS files converted to async — `(async () => {})()` pattern throughout
- [x] 160 sample cards seeded to Supabase on first load, verified in Table Editor
- [x] Create, edit, delete cards — all write to Supabase
- [x] Annotations (reactions + comments) — stored in Supabase `annotations` table
- [x] Deployed to Netlify, verified live

---

## Phase 8 — Polish, Visual Design & Advanced Features

Candidate features (prioritise in Phase 8 based on real usage feedback):

### Visual design pass (deferred from Phase D) — UX-DESIGN-PASS.md (all pages done; Creative V1 on a branch)
- [x] Full typography pass — self-hosted IBM Plex Mono + Sans, six-level scale
- [x] Landing page design — redesigned (hero, method panels, project tiles)
- [x] Analysis page design — **rebuilt as an exploration dashboard** (Decision #33; ANALYSIS-PLAN.md), merged to `main`
- [x] Creative page — **V1 session dashboard, four techniques** (Decision #34; CreativeR&D.md), merged to `main`; later-phase follow-up logged
- [x] Risograph palette — authentic Riso inks + 16-ink tag palette + halftone background + WI/WIF ink-block chips (Decision #35); refined in Decision #36 (method titles + hero chips, warm surface). **Merged to `main` as stable version.**
- [ ] **User-controlled card image effects**: per-card halftone / riso / b&w / contrast filter in the editor (the fixed print filter was removed; this is the opt-in version)
- [ ] References strip legibility pass
- [x] Card surface + background — white cards; background now a **two-ink riso halftone on warm paper** (Decision #35, revisits #26)
- [ ] **What is? / What if? card differentiation** — parked for the next design iteration (Follow ups)
- [ ] **DRAFT marker placement on the card template** — a working black "DRAFT" tag (top-right) ships; revisit where/how it sits on the card in the differentiation pass

### Analysis v2 — largely delivered by the redesign (Decision #33)
- [x] Author × tag contribution matrix → **theme cross-tab** panel
- [x] Annotation heatmap → **per-category annotation overview**
- [x] Tag co-occurrence → kept as the co-occurrence panel
- [x] Coverage map → **force-directed Connections network** (hover-to-highlight; interactive-zoom no longer needed)

### Advanced features
- [x] Catalogue export — **two print modes shipped:** 1-card-per-A4 (`print.html`) + **book/catalogue** (`catalogue.html`): editable cover, What is?/What if? section dividers, continuous theme-headed **2×3** grid filling the page, on-page preview + portrait-A4 PDF export. Merged to `main`.
- [ ] Duplicate card

### Creative mode (stimulus shuffle)
A standalone view — separate nav link — for generative ideation. Not a gallery feature; its own mode.

**What it does:** Two cards side by side — one What Is? observation (from the project's real cards) + one constraint prompt. The juxtaposition is the prompt: *"Here is what you observed. Here is a constraint. What happens to the observation under this pressure?"* This is the forced-association technique from design ideation.

**Build in two versions:**
- **V1 — no AI:** A library of ~50 constraint prompts stored in `data.js` (e.g. "Reverse it", "Make it 10× cheaper", "What if it only lasted 24 hours?", "Who is excluded from this?"). The shuffle picks one random What Is? card + one random prompt. The user can lock either side and re-shuffle the other.
- **V2 — with AI (ON HOLD, Decision #31):** Constraint prompt generated by Claude given the card's title + body. Calibrated to the specific observation rather than generic. Requires Anthropic API key. *Parked until the AI-hold is lifted — build V1 only for now.*

**Interaction:**
- [ ] Shuffle button — picks a new random pair
- [ ] Lock left card / lock right prompt — re-shuffle the other independently
- [ ] "Turn this into a What If? card" — pre-fills create.html with the What Is? card pre-linked and the prompt in the body field
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut: spacebar = shuffle

**UI:** Same card aesthetic, two cards at full display size side by side. Constraint prompt displayed as a styled card-like tile (distinct colour — not green or pink, maybe yellow/orange) so it reads as a different kind of input.

**Data:** Constraint prompt library lives in `data.js` as a plain array. No schema changes. The "lock" state is ephemeral (not saved).
- [ ] Mobile view polish (gallery + card view read-only; create stays desktop-only)
- [ ] Force-directed affinity cluster view (D3.js — requires 15+ cards)

## Security & Robustness Backlog
*Surfaced by the full-site code review on 2026-06-09. The front-end batch below the line was applied that day (tag/imageUrl escaping, `escHtml` quote fix, `:focus-visible` ring, `parseDate` guard, palette-token alignment). The items here remain outstanding.*

### Supabase-dependent (cannot be fixed in front-end alone)
- [ ] **[Critical] Verify RLS is actually enabled** on `projects`, `cards`, `annotations`, and that policies don't expose `editor_password` / `workshop_password` to anon reads. Phase 7 records RLS as enabled — confirm in the dashboard, since with the publishable key in `db.js` an RLS gap means public read/write/delete of all data including passwords.
- [x] **[Critical] Text boxes don't persist** — added `text_boxes jsonb` column + `draft boolean`; `_cardToDb` / `_dbToCard` map both ways.
- [ ] **[High] Move password verification server-side** — passwords are stored plaintext and compared in the browser (`app.js:30`, `landing.js:41`), so they ship to every visitor and the gate is bypassable. Verify via a Supabase RPC / Edge Function that returns only a boolean; stop selecting password columns to anon.
- [ ] **[Medium] Validate JSON import** before upsert — currently any object with `id`+`type` is written (`app.js:336-368`); whitelist fields/types, cap count, and report skipped/rejected records instead of silently dropping them.

### Front-end (behavioural — deferred from the review batch)
- [x] **[High] Card editor unsaved-changes guard** — added `beforeunload` guard (dirty flag set on edits, cleared on save/delete/cancel/back).
- [x] **[High] Keyboard-operable cards & tiles** — project tiles and gallery cards now have `role="button"`+`tabindex`+Enter/Space. *(print cards still click-only — minor.)*
- [x] **[High] Password modal a11y** — focus trap, Escape-to-close, focus return added (landing.js).
- [x] **[High] aria-labels on icon-only controls** — card prev/next arrows now SVG with `aria-label`; `···` trigger has `aria-expanded`.
- [x] **[High] Fix remaining contrast failures** — warn count → `#8A6D00`; `.about-link` → riso-green + underline; What If? new-card button → white on pink.
- [~] **[Medium] Surface failed writes** — reaction add/remove now optimistic **with revert on failure** (card.js). Still open: failed deletes redirect as if successful; comments render optimistically without revert.
- [x] **[Medium] Double-submit guards** — added on project create (`create-project.js`). *(reaction/comment posting still open.)*

### Code quality (lower priority, from review)
- [ ] Read helpers swallow DB errors as `[]`/`null` — can't distinguish "empty" from "failed" (`db.js:79,103,116`).
- [ ] `renderCard` reads the shared global `project` for the header name — pass `projectName` in instead (`db.js:157`, `data.js:1308`).
- [ ] Extract shared helpers: `tagStyle()` (re-implemented ~7×), `checkProjectPassword()` (duplicated landing/app), `cardUrl()` (built ~9× with inconsistent params).
- [ ] Per-text-box `document` mouse listeners never removed (`create.js:358`); dead CSS rulesets/tokens; redundant `image`/`imageUrl` dual fields.

---

*Last updated: 2026-06-23 — Palette refinement complete and merged to `main` as stable version (Decision #36): ink-block chips on method titles + landing hero, warm panel surface. **Page-by-page UX pass complete (9/9 pages).** Phase 8 now = security backlog ([Critical] verify Supabase RLS), card type differentiation, small UX wins, mobile pass. Decisions #31–36 logged.*
