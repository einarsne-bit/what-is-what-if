## Current Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Active phase** | Phase 6 — Deploy & Share |
| **Last session** | Completed 10 gallery UX improvements: floating type-toggle + new-card bar, What Is?/What If? background modes, grouped-by-theme and grouped-by-creator horizontal scroll views, search, author/tag All buttons, compact project bar, sticky header with project-name back button. Two follow-up fixes: horizontal swim-lane layout for grouped sections, type buttons moved into sticky bar. |
| **Immediate next** | Phase 6: data portability (JSON export/import) → Git setup → GitHub → Netlify deploy. |
| **localStorage keys** | `whats-cards`, `whats-projects`, `whats-annotations`, `whats-session-id`, `whats-deleted-samples`, `whats-deleted-projects` |
| **sessionStorage keys** | `whats-active-project`, `whats-access-{projectId}` |
| **Dev environment** | VS Code + Live Server + Claude extension |

## What We've Built

A complete multi-project research card platform with:

- **Landing page** (`index.html`) — project grid with search, "Create new project" CTA, password modal
- **Card gallery** (`gallery.html?project=id`) — filterable grid of A4 cards, What Is? / What If? tabs, print mode
- **Single card view** (`card.html`) — full-size card, prev/next nav, edit/delete, print, share, linked card chips, reactions + comments
- **Card creation** (`create.html`) — edit-in-place A4 card with image drag/drop/pan/zoom, tag autocomplete, What Is?→What If? link picker
- **Project creation** (`create-project.html`) — name/description/passwords form with live tile preview
- **Analysis dashboard** (`analysis.html`) — tag frequency chart, coverage map (WI↔WIF links), timeline, affinity groups, outlier panels
- **About** (`about.html`)

### Access model (client-side prototype)
- Editor password → full CRUD
- Workshop password → annotate-only (reactions + comments, no create/edit/delete)
- No password → automatically editor access
- Stored in `sessionStorage` per project

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML + CSS + vanilla JS | No framework needed yet — keeping it simple |
| Data storage v1 | `localStorage` + `sessionStorage` | No backend needed for prototype |
| Data storage v2 | Supabase (Postgres + RLS) — **EU region (Frankfurt)** | Free tier, beginner-friendly. RLS mandatory. |
| PDF export | **Browser print + `@media print`** | Print gives vector, selectable-text, true A4 |
| Hosting | Netlify (v1) | Free, Git-connected |
| Dev environment | VS Code + Live Server + Claude extension | In-editor AI |

## Research-Informed Principles

1. **This is not "another Miro."** The value is a *structured, research-grounded method* — two card types, A4 template, grounded linking. Resist feature creep toward generic canvas tools.
2. **Design for print from Phase 1.** The card HTML/CSS must stay print-friendly.
3. **Grounded speculation is the method's soul.** What If? cards linking to What Is? cards is core, not optional.
4. **Security is a design task.** The shared-password model must map deliberately to Supabase RLS before Phase 7.
5. **Low threshold wins or loses citizen users.** Playfulness, minimal text entry, one clear action per screen.
6. **Minimise personal data.** No-accounts model keeps annotations naturally anonymous.

## Decisions Log

| # | Question | Decision | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project name | **"What Is? / What If?"** | Brief |
| 2 | Card proportions | **A4 landscape** — matches print template | Brief |
| 3 | Tags | **Hybrid** — suggest existing, allow new | Brief |
| 4 | Collaboration model | **Two passwords per project** — editor (full access) + workshop (annotate only). No user accounts. | Brief |
| 5 | Languages | **English UI for v1** | Brief |
| 6 | Card types | **Two types only** — What Is? + What If? | Brief |
| 7 | Hosting | **Netlify + Supabase** | Brief |
| 8 | User accounts | **No accounts** — name typed manually per card | Brief |
| 9 | Author attribution | **Name field on card template** — no login needed | Brief |
| 10 | Frontend framework | **Vanilla JS** — no framework needed, reassess if complexity grows | R&D |
| 11 | PDF export | **Browser print + `@media print`** primary | R&D |
| 12 | Fonts | **System fonts** for now | R&D |
| 13 | Supabase security | **RLS mandatory** — design access model before Phase 7 | R&D |
| 14 | Data model | **`projectId` on every card** — enables RLS and multi-project from day 1 | Phase 2 |
| 15 | Visual approach | **Function first, design later.** Full visual pass after tool works end-to-end. | Phase 1 |
| 16 | Card shadow | **Hard offset shadow** — solid, 5px offset. No blur. | Phase 1 |
| 17 | Background | **Halftone dot pattern** — Mac System 6 / 80s comic aesthetic | Phase 1 |
| 18 | Card distinction | **Shadow colour** — green for What Is?, pink for What If? | Phase D |
| 19 | Annotation model | **Session reactions + named comments.** UUID in localStorage for reactions; display name for comments. | Phase 5 |
| 20 | Shared data layer | **`js/data.js` loaded first on every page** — project mgmt, cards, tag helpers, renderCard, etc. | Phase 5 |
| 21 | Multi-project | **Multiple projects in localStorage** — `whats-projects` array; sample project always available | Phase M |
| 22 | Access control | **sessionStorage per project** — `whats-access-{id}` = "editor" \| "workshop". Password checked client-side (Supabase RLS in Phase 7). | Phase M |
| 23 | URL design | `gallery.html?project=id`, `card.html?id=&project=id`, `analysis.html?project=id` | Phase M |

## Phase M — Multi-project Platform
**Goal:** The tool supports multiple projects, each with their own cards, passwords, and access levels.
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] `index.html` replaced with landing page — hero intro, project grid with search, password modal
- [x] `gallery.html` — project card gallery (moved from index.html), project-aware, access-enforced
- [x] `create-project.html` — project creation form with name, passwords, live tile preview
- [x] `analysis.html` — analysis dashboard: tag frequency, coverage map, timeline, affinity groups, outliers
- [x] `js/landing.js` — renders project tiles, handles password flow, stores access in sessionStorage
- [x] `js/create-project.js` — saves new project, grants editor access, redirects to gallery
- [x] `js/analysis.js` — all five visualisation panels, responsive SVG-based
- [x] `js/data.js` extended — `getProjects()`, `getProject()`, `saveProject()`, `getActiveProjectId()`, `getProjectAccess()`, `setProjectAccess()`, `loadActiveProject()`, `getProjectCards()`
- [x] `js/app.js` rewritten — project-aware, access control, project-filtered cards
- [x] `js/card.js` updated — project param in all URLs, edit/delete hidden for workshop users
- [x] `js/create.js` updated — project-aware redirects, back/cancel links

### Analysis visualisations
- **Tag frequency** — horizontal dual bars per tag, WI green / WIF pink, top 24 tags
- **Coverage map** — SVG dot diagram: WI cards left, WIF cards right, bezier lines for links, grey = unlinked
- **Timeline** — SVG scatter with WI above / WIF below a date axis, jitter for overlapping dates
- **Affinity groups** — cards clustered by top 16 tags, clickable chips linking to card view
- **Outliers** — four panels: unaddressed WI observations, ungrounded WIF ideas, cards without tags, single-author tags

---

## Phase D — Design & Gallery UX
**Goal:** Polish card template, gallery UX, filtering, background modes.
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] Card shadow colour encodes type (green = WI, pink = WIF)
- [x] Card header: type label centred via CSS grid
- [x] References strip along right card edge
- [x] Gallery: project credits box beside description
- [x] Gallery: filter buttons scoped to current card type
- [x] Tag colours: Risograph palette, consistent per tag via string hash
- [x] Tag autocomplete in create mode
- [x] Image drag/pan/zoom in create mode
- [x] Sticky header with project name (acts as back-to-grid button)
- [x] Sticky action bar: What Is? / What If? type toggle + New card button (always floating)
- [x] What Is? / What If? background mode switching (warm rose halftone for WIF)
- [x] Full-width search across card title, body, author, tags, references
- [x] "Organise by theme" — horizontal swim-lane sections with divider lines
- [x] "Organise by creator" — same swim-lane layout per author
- [x] Author and tag filter rows with "All" button
- [x] Compact project info bar with expandable details

### Remaining design work → moved to Phase 8
The visual design pass (GT Mechanik typography, Cedric Price RE:CP direction, card image effects) is deferred until the tool is deployed and used in a real project. Deploying first gives real usage context for design decisions.

---

## Phase 5 — Single Card View & Annotations
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What was built
- [x] `card.html` + `js/card.js` — full-size card, prev/next nav, keyboard arrows
- [x] Action bar: Back, position indicator, Print, Share, Edit, Delete
- [x] Edit → `create.html?edit=id&project=id`
- [x] Delete — removes from localStorage or adds to deleted-samples list
- [x] Print — popup window, auto-print, auto-close
- [x] Share — copies clean URL to clipboard
- [x] Card links — "Grounded in" (WIF→WI) and "Related ideas" (WI→WIF) chips
- [x] Annotations — session reactions + named comment thread

### Still to do
- [ ] Print cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] "Download as image" PNG (html2canvas fallback)

---

## Phase 6 — Deploy & Share
**Status:** 🔄 Active

### Why this comes before the visual design pass
The tool works end-to-end. Real usage in a real project will give better context for design decisions than designing speculatively. Deploy first, then design for what actually needs improving.

### Part A — Data portability (do first, enables sharing before Supabase)
Without this, collaborators on different devices have no way to share cards. JSON export/import is a one-afternoon build that unblocks real multi-person use.

- [ ] **Export**: "Download project as JSON" button in the project settings or analysis page — exports all project cards + metadata as a `.json` file
- [ ] **Import**: "Import from JSON" file picker — merges cards by ID, skips duplicates, places into the active project
- [ ] Decide where the import/export UI lives (project bar on gallery? settings panel?)

### Part B — Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Create GitHub repo (`what-is-what-if` or `whats-tool`), push current codebase
- [ ] Create Netlify account, connect to GitHub repo — auto-deploys on push to `main`
- [ ] Test all pages on live URL (no build step — pure HTML/CSS/JS, serves directly)
- [ ] Write `README.md` with tool description + how to use

### Decisions to make
- [ ] Domain: free Netlify subdomain or custom?
- [ ] Import/export UI location: gallery project bar? analysis page sidebar?

### What to check before deploying
- All asset paths are relative ✓
- `js/data.js` loads first on every page ✓
- No `localhost` hardcoded URLs ✓
- `crypto.randomUUID()` requires HTTPS — deploy actually fixes this ✓

---

## Phase 7 — Backend & Collaboration (Supabase)
**Status:** ⬜ Not started

> **⚠️ Security is a design task here.** Supabase exposes the DB via a public API + anon key. **Without RLS, every row is publicly readable/writable.** RLS is mandatory. Design the access model *before* writing table code.

### Pre-phase: Access design (do first)
- [ ] Map the two-password model to Supabase auth — Edge Function validates password, grants editor/workshop JWT claim; RLS enforces
- [ ] Write RLS policies scoped by `projectId` and access level

### Steps
- [ ] Create Supabase project — **EU region (Frankfurt)**, accept DPA
- [ ] Create `projects` and `cards` tables
- [ ] Enable RLS on every table; test from client SDK (not SQL editor — bypasses RLS)
- [ ] Replace `localStorage` with Supabase API calls
- [ ] Migrate `whats-annotations` to Supabase
- [ ] Real-time updates — Supabase Realtime subscription so workshop participants see new cards live

---

## Phase 8 — Polish, Visual Design & Advanced Features

Candidate features (prioritise in Phase 8 based on real usage feedback):

### Visual design pass (deferred from Phase D)
- [ ] Full typography pass — GT Mechanik + Cedric Price RE:CP direction (see [design_references.md](design_references_ref.md))
- [ ] Landing page design — currently functional but plain
- [ ] Analysis page design — currently functional but plain
- [ ] Expand Risograph tag colour palette beyond current 5 colours
- [ ] Card image effects: halftone, riso-look, b&w, contrast treatments
- [ ] References strip legibility pass
- [ ] Card background: warm off-white instead of pure white (blueprint paper feel)

### Analysis v2
- [ ] Tag co-occurrence matrix (n×n grid, pure HTML table)
- [ ] Author × tag contribution matrix
- [ ] Interactive zoom on coverage map
- [ ] Annotation heatmap — most-reacted cards surfaced at top of Analysis

### Advanced features
- [ ] Catalogue export — print-all popup (one card per A4 page) or 4-up grid layout
- [ ] Duplicate card

### Creative mode (stimulus shuffle)
A standalone view — separate nav link — for generative ideation. Not a gallery feature; its own mode.

**What it does:** Two cards side by side — one What Is? observation (from the project's real cards) + one constraint prompt. The juxtaposition is the prompt: *"Here is what you observed. Here is a constraint. What happens to the observation under this pressure?"* This is the forced-association technique from design ideation.

**Build in two versions:**
- **V1 — no AI:** A library of ~50 constraint prompts stored in `data.js` (e.g. "Reverse it", "Make it 10× cheaper", "What if it only lasted 24 hours?", "Who is excluded from this?"). The shuffle picks one random What Is? card + one random prompt. The user can lock either side and re-shuffle the other.
- **V2 — with AI:** Constraint prompt generated by Claude given the card's title + body. Calibrated to the specific observation rather than generic. Requires Anthropic API key (Phase 7+).

**Interaction:**
- [ ] Shuffle button — picks a new random pair
- [ ] Lock left card / lock right prompt — re-shuffle the other independently
- [ ] "Turn this into a What If? card" — pre-fills create.html with the What Is? card pre-linked and the prompt in the body field
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut: spacebar = shuffle

**UI:** Same card aesthetic, two cards at full display size side by side. Constraint prompt displayed as a styled card-like tile (distinct colour — not green or pink, maybe yellow/orange) so it reads as a different kind of input.

**Data:** Constraint prompt library lives in `data.js` as a plain array. No schema changes. The "lock" state is ephemeral (not saved).
- [ ] Mobile view polish (gallery + card view read-only; create stays desktop-only)
- [ ] Force-directed affinity cluster view (D3.js — requires 15+ cards)
